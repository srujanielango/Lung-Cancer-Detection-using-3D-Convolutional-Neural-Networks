    "# Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the United States, lung cancer strikes 225,000 people every year, and accounts for $12 billion in health care costs. Early detection is critical to give patients the best chance at recovery and survival. One year ago, the office of the U.S. Vice President spearheaded a bold new initiative, the Cancer Moonshot, to make a decade's worth of progress in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in just 5 years. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2017, the Data Science Bowl will be a critical milestone in support of the Cancer Moonshot by convening the data science and medical communities to develop lung cancer detection algorithms. Using a data set of thousands of high-resolution lung scans provided by the National Cancer Institute, participants will develop algorithms that accurately determine when lesions in the lungs are cancerous. This will dramatically reduce the false positive rate that plagues the current detection technology, get patients earlier access to life-saving interventions, and give radiologists more time to spend with their patients.\n",

    "# Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to evaluate the data (Slices of CT scans) provided with various pre-processing techniques and analyze the data using machine learning algorithms, in this case 3D Convolutional Neural Networks to train and validate the model, to create an accurate model which can be used to determine whether a person has cancer or not. This will greatly help in the identification and elimination of cancer cells in the early stages. Therefore, an automated method capable of determining whether the patient will be diagnosed with lung cancer is the aim of this project."
